        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I'm a first year data analytics student, changing into Database Administration for my second year. I have a BSc with a major in biology from SMU, where I developed my love for data and organizing data. I was born in Cardiff but moved to Canda when I was around 8 years old and I love everything that Canada has to offer. I look forward to continuing to developping my skills and careers as I move forward with my diploma. I'm currently doing a work term through NSCC and the PSSH project, and we're wanting to get to the root of why are there so many post secondary students that are homeless and how do we begin to really change this.</p>
